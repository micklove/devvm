## Express project, ${PROJECT_NAME}
${PROJECT_NAME} is a very simple example node js express application, generated by ${GENERATION_PROJECT}

---

#### Run the express service
By default, the express server will listen on port `${PROJECT_LISTEN_PORT}`

The env var `ADMIN_NOT_VERY_SECRET` is used for a basic auth challenge, and must be set on server startup, or else the service will not start.
```bash
ADMIN_NOT_VERY_SECRET=whateversecretilike make run
node src/server.js
${PROJECT_NAME} listening at http://localhost:${PROJECT_LISTEN_PORT}
```

To override the listen port, use the following command
```bash
PROJECT_LISTEN_PORT=3000 \
ADMIN_NOT_VERY_SECRET=whateversecretilike \
    make run
```

#### Dependencies
