## Express project, ${PROJECT_NAME}
${PROJECT_NAME} is a simple node js express application, generated by ${GENERATION_PROJECT}

By default, the express server will listen on port `${PROJECT_LISTEN_PORT}`
```bash
make run
node src/server.js
${PROJECT_NAME} listening at http://localhost:${PROJECT_LISTEN_PORT}

```
To override the listen port, use the following command
```bash
PROJECT_LISTEN_PORT=3000 make run
```
